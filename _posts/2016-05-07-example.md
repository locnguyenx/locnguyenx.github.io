Some basic Markdown syntax to guide how to write a post.
First at all, jekyll will automatically takes the first block of text, from the beginning of the content to the first occurrence of `excerpt_separator`.
We may override this auto excerpt by adding `excerpt` value into the page or add customse `excerpt_separator` in a post or globally.
